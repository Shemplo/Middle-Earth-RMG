# Random map template (Heroes 3 - HotA)

The two sides decided to find out which of them is stronger. But only one problem - between 
them are neutral lands filled with dangerous creatures and the untold riches they guard. They 
say there is still a secret passage between the sides, but the path is thorny and risky, no 
one knows what awaits you on that path, you may need a guide or strong army. Welcome to the
**Middle Earth**.

    winner is the player with bigger sum of characteristics (if sums are equal 
    then by tossing a coin).  
* Since **126** you can recruit one more hero from tavern. This actions is allowed only once, it means
that if you lose the second hero (even if it can surrender or retreat), you have to finish the game 
having only 1 (main) hero. The second hero **can't attack** opponent heroes and **can't be attacked**
with opponent heroes.  
    * Second hero can't block path on road if there is only 1 tile in width between
any obstacles. If second hero have no more move points and blocks the route then you have to banish him
(and never buy any other second heroes).
